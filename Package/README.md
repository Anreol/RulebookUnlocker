# RulebookUnlocker

Simple mod that will enable the hidden Item Catalog, Equipment Catalog, and Modifiers (The ones you can see in Prismatic Trials!).
Automatically shows any items or equipment added by mods.
Can be configurated to hide each category / individual modifier.

It will only show up in the default gamemode (ClassicRun), meaning no cheating is allowed in Eclipse.

#### Known Issues
Due to how the game handles rules with more than two choices, the money rule is rather buggy. Hit the random button to make it roll, or cycle through a different rule to be able to vote for it again.
With enough items or equipment, the menu will start overflowing outside the screen, [https://thunderstore.io/package/KingEnderBrine/ScrollableLobbyUI/] will take care of this problem.
